### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a **non-financial accounting information system** to measure and publish environnemental and social impacts of the produced value of companies, on major subjects such as greenhouse emissions, gender inequality or water consumption. Default and published data are available for french companies by their *siren* identifiant on an **open database**.
The information system is based on the financial accountings of companies to ensure traceability, and which make it already operationnal.

More information on [La SociÃ©tÃ© Nouvelle](https://www.la-societe-nouvelle.fr)

Interactive parts of the information system are going to be open source. Soon, you will be able to contribute on :
- the API to access the database
- the Website to improve the resoucres availables
- and all the contents and tools provided to measure the indicators

Let's build a sustainable economy !
